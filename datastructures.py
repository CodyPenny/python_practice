# data structures are containers that organize and group data types together

# can use negative index, -1 is the last element
# is an item in a list? use 'in' or 'not in' keyword, returns bool

# mutability - can an object change once it's been created
# lists are mutable. Strings are NOT mutable or immutable
# order - if position of an element can be used to access the element
# strings and lists are ordered
# list methods

# TUPLES

# for immutable ordered sequence - can't add, remove or sort them in place
# often to store related pieces of info
# use parenthesis but also can be omitted if it doesn't clarify the code
# can use index to access and it can hold different types
# can assign multiple variables in a compact way
# useful for data integrity

# SETS
# for mutable, unordered collection of unique elements
# application is to quickly remove dups from a list

# sets support the in operator as lists do
# use curly braces to define or set()
# can use add method, pop method removes a random element
# it's unordered so there is no 'last' element

# sets can performm mathematical sets, union, intersection, difference and are faster than other containers

# DICTIONARY
# mutable, stores mappings of unique keys to values
# keys of any immutable type, can be int, tuples, strings, are unique
# indexed using keys
# unordered, cannot be sorted
# can use in operator to see if a value is in the dictionary
# has is or is not operator that evaluates both sides if same identity or different
# has method get
# has method keys
# has method values which grabs the value
# has method items which gets the pairings
